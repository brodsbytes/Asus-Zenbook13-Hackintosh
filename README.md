# Asus-Zenbook13-Hackintosh

This is an EFI used for booting OpenCore &amp; MacOS 14 (Sonoma) / 15 (Sequoia) on an Asus Zenbook 13 UX331.
I do not own any of these files or code, all credit goes to respective developers.

There were neccessary kexts, drivers and config.plist adjustments that was not mentioned in most guides (https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/) that took me a while to gather for this specific model.

It's been a journey getting it to the the post-install stage, but I'm stopping here and wanted to share my EFI in case it helps anyone else.


Things that are still not working for my build (with supposedly compatible kexts):

-WiFi

-Trackpad


Thanks!
