# Asus-Zenbook13-Hackintosh

This is an EFI used for booting OpenCore &amp; MacOS 14 (Sonoma) / 15 (Sequioa) on an Asus Zenbook 13 UX331.

There were neccessary kexts, drivers and adjustments in the config.plist that was not mentioned in the Dortania OpenCore guide (https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/) that took me a while to gather for this specific model.

It's been a journey getting it to the the post-install stage, but I'm stopping here and wanted to share my EFI in case it helps anyone else.


Things that are still not working for my build (with supposedly compatible kexts):
-WiFi
-Trackpad


Thanks!
